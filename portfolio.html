                Cinematic Swordfight Simulator is a minimalist art style 2D swordfighting party game. Grab a few controllers and duel to the death against your friends, blade to blade!
                <br><br>I made Cinematic Swordfight Simulator in the Game Maker 2 engine, and made it available online at itch.io February 2021.
                CSS, as I like to call it, is a two-player fighting party game played on controllers that puts two players in opposition armed with swords and scarves.

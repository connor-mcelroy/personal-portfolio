        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>
            My name is Connor McElroy, and I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Idaho. 
            I am studying specifically towards becoming a game developer, and have completed several independent video game projects of various genres,
            which can be seen on my portfolio page. I have knowledge of programming in C, C++, C#, and HTML/CSS. When I have some time and I'm not putting
            it towards coding, I can be found practicing longsword fencing with the Inland Northwest Longsword Academy, playing airsoft, skiing, rock climbing,
             and writing short novels.
